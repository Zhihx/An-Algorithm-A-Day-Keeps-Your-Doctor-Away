# Image-Processing-for-Denoising

An imaging processing repo for denosing task, mainly for self-learning. Mehtods included are classified into two groups: model-based and data-driven. Hope this repo can help my learning for imaging processing, optimization and deep learning.

Methods check-list:
1. BM3D: block matching & 3D filtering
2. FFDNet: fast and flexible denosing convolutional neural network
